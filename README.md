# Master-curve-project
An algorithm that does Time Temperature Superposition (TTS) that is packaged in a user interface. 

The programming was done using MATLAB. See the user manual to learn how to use the interface. I provide example data that can be imported into the interface. There is example saved data in the 'MatData' folder that can be opened through the interface. There is an example of the exported data in the 'ExportData' folder. 

The code for the figures are in the main folder. All the functions that make the program work are in the 'private' folder. 

I also included a poster that presents the project.
